📈 From Data to Dashboard: A Complete Power BI Tutorial with BMW Sales Data 🏁

In this project, I worked with BMW sales data and transformed it into an interactive Power BI dashboard. Through this journey, I learned how to:

✅ Clean and prepare data in Excel and Power BI for accurate analysis.
✅ Use key DAX measures to calculate insights, such as:

Avg Price → Average sales price of BMW cars.

Avg Price Formatted → Same as Avg Price but formatted for reporting.

Qty Sold → Total cars sold in the selected period.

Qty PY → Quantity sold in the previous year (for YoY comparison).

Qty Growth → Growth in sales quantity compared to last year.

Qty Variance → Difference in sales quantity between periods.

Qty Variance % → Percentage variance in sales quantity.

Revenue → Total revenue generated from sales.

Revenue PY → Revenue generated in the previous year.

Revenue Growth → Growth in revenue compared to last year.

Revenue Variance → Difference in revenue between periods.

Revenue Variance % → Percentage variance in revenue.

Sparklines (Qty & Revenue) → Trend lines to quickly visualize movement of quantity and revenue.

Selected Period → Dynamic filter to calculate metrics based on chosen time.

✅ Improve interactivity using slicers, buttons, and bookmarks for smooth navigation and drill-down experience.
✅ Visualize KPIs with bar charts, line charts, cards, and maps for better storytelling.
✅ Apply formatting and design principles to make the dashboard both professional and user-friendly.
✅ Enhance visuals by sourcing BMW car images and country flag icons from the internet.

This project helped me strengthen my data analysis, DAX, visualization, interactivity design, and business intelligence skills—transforming raw sales data into actionable insights for decision-making.
